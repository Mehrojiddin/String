## Extracting String Parts
There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:

slice(start, end)
substring(start, end)
substr(start, length)

slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).
